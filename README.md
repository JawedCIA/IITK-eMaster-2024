> During the completion of Assignment-1, a few batchmates came together to work collaboratively, engaging in discussions, Q&A sessions, and idea sharing. 
> Collaboration occurred over WhatsApp calls/messages, a private GitHub repository, Zoom meetings, etc. 
> However, we made sure not to share code with each other, focusing instead on exchanging ideas and discussing the logic required to accomplish the task.

> We took utmost precaution to avoid directly sharing code, 
> but it's possible that some pieces of code may have inadvertently slipped between us. Therefore, it's possible that you might notice similarities in the logic or code under certain tasks.
