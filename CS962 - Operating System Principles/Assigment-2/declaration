I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.
cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is
a severe offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any
plagiarism. If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow
students, etc., then strict action can be taken against me. 233560019.



Consulted with Mr. Arun via email while working on these tasks; 
he provided pointers regarding the errors encountered during implementation which helped me to kick start the Taks implementation.
However, the assignment document provided sufficient guidance to start with Task-1 & Task-2. 
It was well-written with ample content.

Task-3 proved to be challenging, particularly in dealing with putting all the peices togethor. 
I encountered numerous issues and resorted to searching mainly on GitHub for relevant code examples. 
I even examined the GemOS code available on GitHub to gain insights into internal workings.
Eventually, I realized that the assignment document itself contained the necessary details. 
Nonetheless, the code available on GitHub aided in connecting all the dots related to Task-3.

Thank you!
