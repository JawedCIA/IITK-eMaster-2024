## eMasters Program Journey Insights
### Short Mantra:
- **Discipline**: Attempt all quizzes, exams, and submit all homework/assignments on time. With this consistency, you’ll pass any module.

### Long Mantra:
1. **Dedication and Effort**:
   - Requires focus, time, and self-learning.
   - Supplement lectures with additional resources (YouTube, articles, etc.) for deeper understanding.

2. **Collaboration**:
   - Form a like-minded study group on platforms like WhatsApp to stay connected, share ideas, and discuss concepts.
   - Lean on your group for support during overwhelming times.

3. **Overcoming Challenges**:
   - When sessions feel fast-paced or overwhelming, avoid overthinking—reach out to group members for help and encouragement.
